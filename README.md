## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
This project is developed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. To run the notebooks, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Dependencies
The following libraries are necessary to run the project:
- `numpy` for numerical operations,
- `matplotlib` for plotting,
- `h5py` for handling H5 files,
- Custom testing scripts (assumed as `public_tests`).

### Installation
1. Install Python and Jupyter, if you haven't already. An easy way to install these together is through the Anaconda distribution.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory.
4. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib h5py
   ```
5. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

### Getting Started
Open the Jupyter Notebook in the repository. Each notebook contains detailed comments explaining the steps involved in the process, making it easy to follow.

### Example Usage
To run the convolution model step by step:
1. Open the `Convolution_model_Step_by_Step.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially to observe how the convolution operations are performed, including forward and backward passes.

## Features
- **Zero Padding**: Adds zeros to the perimeter of an input matrix to preserve border information.
- **Convolution Operations**: Includes forward and backward convolution operations implemented from scratch.
- **Pooling Operations**: Implements both max and average pooling operations.
- **Backpropagation**: Detailed implementation of the backward pass for convolution and pooling layers.
